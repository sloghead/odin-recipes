        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken and Mushroom Alfredo is a comforting dish that I love. Mushrooms are not for everyone, but they add a special zing that I relish. Though, I do love mushrooms of all shapes and sizes, so I might be a little biased.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>Two 6 ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>One 16 ounce package fetuccini</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup salted butter</li>
            <li>Two cups sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>One medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Two cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>One 8 ounce package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>Two cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>Salt and ground white pepper to taste</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a baking pan with cooking spray, place chicken breasts in the pan, and cover with a lid or foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and shred with 2 forks.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is roasting, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add mushrooms and onion; saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low and add cream cheese; stir until melted. Whisk in heavy cream and season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
            <li>Add Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, reduce heat to low, and simmer until all combined and creamy, about 3 minutes. Don't simmer for to long or over high heat; the sauce can break down and become curdled instead of creamy.</li>
            <li>Drain pasta and add to sauce with shredded chicken.</p></li>
            
        </ol>
